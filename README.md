# Autonomous Vehicel 

## Overview 
This repository contains a simulation of an autonomous 4 wheeled scooter using Gazebo and ROS (Robot Operating System). The vehicle is equipped with sensors such as RGBD camera, and IMU to perform localization, mapping, and path planning tasks. It is designed to operate in a dynamic environment with moving obstacles and stationary barriers.
For path planning and obstacle avoidance we used RL + APF method to achieve our goal.we didnt need localization here because we had goal and obstacle distance and angle with respect to the car.
